Drew, Joe, and Brandon.

This file contains my code for the signal functions. I realized that the
existing signal functions will not suffice. This module should do the
proper processing for iBCS signals.

There are patches to the emulate module offered by Drew in his pl14n code
release. The Makefile was changed to include the module.

In addition, I have include a signal.doc file which contains the text from
my UNIX S5 manual describing the functions used by iBCS. I based the
emulator code on this document. Please look it over and see if I have
messed up. I believe it to be correct. However, it never hurts to have
someone check the work before we can trust it.

It follows what I believe to be the proper calling sequence for signals. I
sent a message to the IBSC2 group with the text from the McGraw Hill book
concerning signals. If you would like a copy of the message, then let me
know.

Of couse, this could be totally wrong. That is the whole point about
sending this out to a limited distribution.

In addition to the processing for the various function requests, you may
have noticed that the signal _numbers_ must be changed between the values
used by iBCS and Linux.

I have had to modify the emulate.c module to export an additional
procedure (and for emulate.c to use the procedure itself.) In addition, I
change the branch table to re-direct the signal processing to the signal.c
module.

I hope that this will help the project when it has been proven workable.
Please let me know how this turns out -- one way or the other.

If it does work, then I'll give the final code to Drew to merge into the
master code. That is unless, Drew, you already have it. :-)

Thanks much.
