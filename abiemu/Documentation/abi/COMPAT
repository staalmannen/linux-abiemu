V: Applied Information Systems, Inc. (info@ais.com)
O:	SCO
P:		Xess (MOTIF Spreadsheet)
R:		current
L:		statically linked
N:		A save-disabled demo is available in ftp.uu.net:/vendor/ais/
N:		Get three files: README, gen.tar, and sco.tar.
N:		Don't add a .Z or .gz to the end of the filenames; the files
N:		inside are compressed.  ~300K of online documentation is in
N:		gen.tar.
N:		If anyone decides to actually *buy* this product, *please*
N:		mention that you will be running it under Linux.  I promise
N:		you that you will still get technical support (the majority
N:		of our technical support staff run Linux at home) -- but if
N:		enough people buy the product asking for a Linux version, my
N:		employer will be willing to make the investment.  Pass the
N:		word on if you want to see a native-mode, high-quality
N:		spreadsheet for Linux as much as I do...

V: Corel
O:	SCO ODT
P:		CorelDraw! 3.0 and friends.
R:		3.0
N:		Requires X11, no character versions of these apps.
N:		Everything seems to be statically linked, no extra libs
N:		necessary.  I had a few problems with my .xmodmap file
N:		since CorelDraw wants all of the lower function keys to
N:		be mapped to functions in the CorelDraw program.  Uses a
N:		networked license manager, it worked fine.  My programs
N: 		did not install properly due to an install bug.  The dir.
N:		that contains the washes.3fx file and others must be hand
N:		changed to mode 777 for CorelChart to work (This from
N:		Corel tech support).

R:		???
L:		/shlib/libnsl_s
N:		The version of X.desktop tested is that shipped with

N:		support Uniplex Windows.

O:	SCO
P:		SPSS 5.0 for SCO UNIX
L:		Motif, if you want to use the GUI
D:		Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
N:		SCO's cpio is not compatible with GNU's -- I had to dd all

N:		I couldn't test the GUI since I had no Motif available.

R:		7.02
L:		statically linked (Uniplex Windows requires libnsl_s)
N:		Uniplex Windows is implemented using a version of IXI
N:		X.desktop. It is this that requires libnsl_s.

V: WordPerfect Corporation
O:	SCO
P:		WordPerfect (character and X)
R:		5.1
L:		Statically linked
N:		Installation under Linux may require changes to some of
N:		the WP install scripts. See the PROD.Patches/WP file
N:		for details.
N:
N:		WP uses a network license manager.
N:
N:		For some reason WP use a partition floppy device rather
N:		than the full block device. Linux does not have this so
N:		you need to use dd to skip the first cylinder (track?)
N:		when loading the floppies under Linux. See the HINTS
N:		file for details.
N:
N:		Fonts appear corrupt. See the HINTS file for a cure.
