 * lnxstamp

	Usage: lnxstamp file ...

	This program scans the list of files specified on the command
line and for all those that appear to be executable but have a machine
type of 0 it changes the machine type to 100. Old (very old) Linux
linkers left the machine type as 0 and there are still old binaries
around (use the magic file in this directory and 'file' your /bin and
/usr/bin directories). The i386 BSD flavours use 0 as the machine type
so if we update our old Linux binaries we can tell the difference. This
is essential if you want to have BSD emulation.
